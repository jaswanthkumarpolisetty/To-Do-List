# To-Do List Application

This is a simple To-Do List application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to add tasks, mark them as completed, and delete them. The tasks are stored in the browser's local storage so that they persist even after refreshing the page.

## Features

- **Add Task**: Users can add tasks by entering text into the input field and clicking the "Add" button.
- **Mark Task as Completed**: Clicking on a task will toggle its completion status, visually indicating it with a line-through.
- **Delete Task**: Clicking on the "×" button next to a task will remove it from the list.
- **Local Storage**: Tasks are saved in the browser's local storage, ensuring they persist across page reloads.

## Project Structure

- **index.html**: The main HTML file that contains the structure of the To-Do List.
- **style.css**: The CSS file that styles the To-Do List application.
- **script.js**: The JavaScript file that contains the functionality to add, complete, delete tasks, and manage local storage.
- **images**: A folder containing images used for task icons (`unchecked.png`, `checked.png`, `icon.png`).
